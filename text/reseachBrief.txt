Our goal for the final project of Webware at WPI was create a website from the ground up
starting with the design. The first thing we did was brain storm ideas for what we could
have as the theme of our project. Eventually we ended up with the idea of a freelance
company for dwarves. After having our idea, we started to come up with mock designs of a
potential company website. We finally decided one one layout that we all agreed was clean
and looked professional. From the design, we moved into the implementation of this company
website. We began with the layout template and slowly built our way up until we were
connecting a database with our dwarf workers into the main web page. From there we just
needed to do a few minor tweaks to make sure everything was clean and working properly.

We wanted to create a company that could be realistic. There are plenty freelance
companies whose job it is to just assign workers to various jobs, so we wanted to base our
company off this model. Since our team name was 'Red Dwarf', we thought it would be fun to
incorporate our name into the project somehow, so low and behold, Dwarf freelancing
company.
